## Key Features & Enhancements                                        
**1. Enhanced Card Customization**                                                   
Format each card uniquely with different styles, images, or text.                                       
Ideal for displaying key information per item (e.g., employee name, product details).

**2. Advanced Filtering & Search**                                                    
Text slicers now support keyword-based filtering (e.g., by name).                                        
Dropdown slicers allow filtering by attributes like office or job position.                                     

**3. Context-Aware Conditional Formatting**                                                             
Cards now recognize filter context, enabling conditional changes.                                                           
Apply dynamic formatting (e.g., card color, image) based on selected values.                                          

**4. Dynamic Image Integration**                                         
Images can be linked using measures or columns with URLs.                                               
Supports public image hosting and allows custom sizing and positioning.

Transition from tables to cards improves visual clarity.
Single-column layout improves readability for profile-type data.

**2. Reference Labels for Rich Details**
Add supplementary information like email, position, office, phone number.
Customize visibility and placement for better visual balance.

**3. Consistent Card Dimensions**
Maintain uniform card sizes when filters are applied.
Prevent layout shifts using fixed tile count in small multiples.
