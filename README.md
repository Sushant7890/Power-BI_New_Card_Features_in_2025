## Key Features & Enhancements                                        
**1. Enhanced Card Customization**                                                                                                
Format each card uniquely with different styles, images, or text.                                                                                                   
Ideal for displaying key information per item (e.g., employee name, product details).                                  

**2. Advanced Filtering & Search**                                                                                                       
Text slicers now support keyword-based filtering (e.g., by name).                                                                                       
Dropdown slicers allow filtering by attributes like office or job position.

Cards now recognize filter context, enabling conditional changes.                                                                                    
Apply dynamic formatting (e.g., card color, image) based on selected values.

Images can be linked using measures or columns with URLs.                                                                                        
Supports public image hosting and allows custom sizing and positioning.                                                      

## Layout & Design Improvements
**1. Flexible Layout Options**                                              
Transition from tables to cards improves visual clarity.                                          
Single-column layout improves readability for profile-type data.                                                                            

**2. Reference Labels for Rich Details**                                                                           
Add supplementary information like email, position, office, phone number.                                                               
Customize visibility and placement for better visual balance.                                                                      

**3. Consistent Card Dimensions**                                                                   
Maintain uniform card sizes when filters are applied.                                                                
Prevent layout shifts using fixed tile count in small multiples.                      

**4. Improved Grid & Scrolling Behavior**                                                                                              
Multi-row/column display allows better card arrangement.                                                                     
Continuous scrolling replaces pagination for smoother navigation.                              

## Visual & Text Formatting Enhancements
**1. Label and Font Styling**                                                                                         
Customize font size, color, and visibility of callouts and labels.                                  
Hide label titles (e.g., “first position”) for cleaner display.                                    

**2. Padding, Spacing, and Rounded Corners**                              
Improve layout using extra spacing, rounded edges, and minimal padding.                                  
Align elements neatly with spacing between cards.                               

## Versatile Applications
**These features can be used across departments like:**                                    
**HR:** Employee directories                                        
**Sales:** Product or client cards                               
**Finance:** Region-wise performance cards                               

## Conclusion
The March 2025 Power BI update is a game changer for dashboard developers. With flexible design options, advanced interactivity, and clean layouts, users can now create modern, functional, and user-friendly dashboards using the new card visuals.
