## Key Features & Enhancements                                        
**1. Enhanced Card Customization**                                                                                                
Format each card uniquely with different styles, images, or text.                                                                                                   
Ideal for displaying key information per item (e.g., employee name, product details).                                  

**2. Advanced Filtering & Search**                                                                                                       
Text slicers now support keyword-based filtering (e.g., by name).                                                                                       
Dropdown slicers allow filtering by attributes like office or job position.                                                                                    

**3. Context-Aware Conditional Formatting**                                                                                                            
Cards now recognize filter context, enabling conditional changes.                                                                                    
Apply dynamic formatting (e.g., card color, image) based on selected values.                                                                                  

**4. Dynamic Image Integration**                                                                                                   
Images can be linked using measures or columns with URLs.                                                                                        
Supports public image hosting and allows custom sizing and positioning.                                                      

## Layout & Design Improvements
**1. Flexible Layout Options**                                              
Transition from tables to cards improves visual clarity.                                          
Single-column layout improves readability for profile-type data.                                                                            

**2. Reference Labels for Rich Details**                                                                           
Add supplementary information like email, position, office, phone number.                                                               
Customize visibility and placement for better visual balance.                                                                      

**3. Consistent Card Dimensions**                                                                   
Maintain uniform card sizes when filters are applied.                                                                
Prevent layout shifts using fixed tile count in small multiples.                      

**4. Improved Grid & Scrolling Behavior**                                                                                              
Multi-row/column display allows better card arrangement.

## Visual & Text Formatting Enhancements
**1. Label and Font Styling**                                                                                         
Customize font size, color, and visibility of callouts and labels.                                  
Hide label titles (e.g., “first position”) for cleaner display.                                    

**2. Padding, Spacing, and Rounded Corners**                              
Improve layout using extra spacing, rounded edges, and minimal padding.                                  
Align elements neatly with spacing between cards.                               

## Versatile Applications
**These features can be used across departments like:**                                    
**HR:** Employee directories                                        
**Sales:** Product or client cards                               
**Finance:** Region-wise performance cards                               

## Conclusion
The March 2025 Power BI update is a game changer for dashboard developers. With flexible design options, advanced interactivity, and clean layouts, users can now create modern, functional, and user-friendly dashboards using the new card visuals.
